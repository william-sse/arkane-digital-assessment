# Project Documentation

## Overview

This project is a simple front-end application developed using React framework and Bootstrap design framework. It displays event cards retrieved from a headless CMS and renders them in a user-friendly format. The application is designed to list events for the world-renowned venue "Bob's Orchestra Hall" located in Seattle, WA.

## Technologies Used

- React: A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- JavaScript: The programming language used for implementing the application logic.
- HTML: The markup language used for creating the structure of the web pages.
- CSS: The styling language used for applying visual styles to the web pages.

## Installation

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the project repository from GitHub:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/william-sse/arkane-digital-assessment.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory and install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd arkane-digital-assessment
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. Start the testing server:

   ```bash
   npm run test
   ```

5. Open your web browser and visit http://localhost:3000 to view the application.

The project follows a standard structure for a React application. Here are the key directories and files:

- `public/`: This directory contains the static assets and the main HTML file (`index.html`) that serves as the entry point for the application.
- `src/`: This directory contains the source code of the application.
  - `api/`: This directory contains the mock API implementation (`mock.js`) that simulates querying an API from a headless CMS.
  - `components/`: This directory contains the React components used in the application.
    - `Event.jsx`: This component represents an individual event card and displays the event details.
    - `EventList.jsx`: This component lists all the events by rendering multiple instances of the `Event` component.
    - `Loading.jsx`: This component displays a loading message while the events are being fetched.
  - `hooks/`: This directory contains custom React hooks used in the application.
    - `useEventListFetch.js`: This hook handles the API call to fetch the event list and manages the loading and error states.
  - `styles/`: This directory contains the CSS styles used in the application.
    - `styles.css`: This css files contains the styles for the application.
  - `App.js`: This is the main component that renders the application and includes the logic for fetching and displaying the event list.
  - `index.js`: This is the entry point of the application that renders the `App` component into the DOM.
  - `App.test.js`: This file contains unit tests for the `App` component.
  - `package.json`: This file contains the project configuration and dependencies.

## Features

The following features can be implemented in the application if I have more time:

1. **Search and Filtering**: Add a search bar and filtering options to allow users to search for specific events or filter events based on criteria such as date, category, or location.

2. **Event Details**: Create a separate page or modal to display detailed information about each event when clicked on. Include additional details such as event description, location on a map, ticket prices, and a button to purchase tickets.

3. **User Authentication**: Implement user authentication and authorization to allow users to log in and save their favorite events, RSVP to events, and receive personalized recommendations.

4. **Event Creation**: Build a form for authorized users to create and manage events. Include fields for event title, description, date, time, location, category, and image upload.

5. **Social Sharing**: Add social media sharing buttons to allow users to share events with their friends on platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.

6. **Event Reminders**: Implement a feature that allows users to set event reminders and receive notifications via email or push notifications.

7. **Event Recommendations**: Use machine learning algorithms to analyze user preferences and provide personalized event recommendations based on their past activity, interests, and location.

8. **Event RSVP and Ticketing Integration**: Integrate with popular ticketing platforms such as Eventbrite or Ticketmaster to enable users to purchase tickets directly from the application.

These additional features can enhance the functionality and user experience of the application. Prioritize and implement them based on the requirements and goals of the project.

## Additional Information

In addition to the technologies used and the features that can be implemented, here are a few more details to consider for this project:

- The project uses React to leverage their powerful features and ease of development. React is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

- The mock API implementation provides a simulated data source for testing and development purposes. This allows to develop and test the application without relying on a real backend API.

- The project follows best practices for code organization and structure. It uses a component-based architecture, where each UI element is encapsulated into a reusable component. This promotes code reusability, maintainability, and scalability.

- The project is built with performance in mind. React's virtual DOM and efficient rendering algorithm help optimize the application's performance by minimizing unnecessary re-renders. Additionally, the use of lazy loading and code splitting techniques can further enhance the performance by reducing the initial load time.

- The project is version-controlled using a Git repository. This allows for easy collaboration, tracking of changes, and the ability to revert to previous versions if needed.

By considering these additional details, you can ensure a well-designed, customizable, and performant application that meets the project requirements.
